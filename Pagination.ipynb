Journey is looking for an experienced and customer driven software engineer who can translate business requirements into high quality products. Successful Journey engineers enjoy exploring the why of the product in addition to the how. Recognizing that customer experience is pivotal to the success of a product or service is also a requirement for this job. As an agile team, the decision making process is driven by the ability to create the most compelling product for our customers, while simultaneously taking into account the natural limitations of a start-up environment.</p>\\n<p>Responsibilities &amp; Growth</p>\\n<p>The immediate need is for an intermediate to senior individual contributor for our in-progress products. This will quickly be eclipsed as our product suite grows to become a core product design and development role that includes the role of Product Owner.</p>\\n<p>Journey has just completed validation of the MVP of one of our products and now must scale up the team to meet customer needs. The successful candidate is immediately a critical contributor to this product’s development.</p>\\n<p>The startup environment also creates an environment for broader opportunities and responsibilities.</p>\\n<p>Technologies</p>\\n<p>Journey uses a modern suite of development tools wrapped in the SAFE agile methodology. Our development technologies include (but are not limited to) React for the frontend, and Go for the backend. Deployment is targeted at public cloud, private cloud and virtual private cloud environments. A CI/CD pipeline is in place to build and deploy via Github Actions. As a state of the art start-up, Journey has the opportunity to use the best available frameworks and tools, including browser based Tensorflow for our ML features</p>\\n<p>The Ideal Candidate</p>\\n<p>The ideal candidate will have a strong software background and a broad interest in the rapid evolution of software development and tools. This has been demonstrated through commercial experience as well as personal interests and projects. Direct experience with our current software tools is not a prerequisite, but proven experience with a strongly-typed language in a production environment is desired. You must have an understanding of system architecture, particularly when it comes to redundancy and reliability. You take pride in your work and want to grow, both at Journey and in your career.</p>\\n<p>The successful candidate will be a self-starter, an engineer who seeks to understand and discover and an engineer who has a desire to become part of a highly empowered team with a deep understanding of our product, our market and the key metrics of success.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You have been working on web projects for long enough that you reminisce &amp; complain about the old days of Javascript.</li>\\n<li>You feel very confident building React apps using Redux.</li>\\n<li>You have extensive experience with a strongly-typed language in a production environment.</li>\\n</ul>\\n',\n",

       "  'description': '<p><strong>software architect</strong>\\nDe politie heeft oog en oor voor wat er leeft in de samenleving en werkt actief samen met de inwoners van Nederland. Daarbij is de verbinding met de maatschappij via diverse websites en applicaties onmisbaar. Als IT-projectmanager in Odijk leg jij mede de basis voor optimaal toegankelijke publieke kanalen.</p>\\n<p><strong>Wat ga je doen?</strong>\\nJe bent eigenaar van technische applicaties waarmee burgers verbinding kunnen maken met de politie of informatie kunnen opvragen. Denk aan de mogelijkheid voor aangifte via internet, informatieve websites als politie.nl en de servicemodule 0900-8844. Maar ook aan Burgernet en Amber Alert waarmee we burgers vragen mee te helpen bij calamiteiten. Je werkt aan oplossingen die deze kanalen nóg toegankelijker maken. En je denkt mee over hoe we nieuwe technologieën kunnen inzetten voor de communicatie met het publiek.</p>\\n<p>Als IT-projectmanager ben jij de kartrekker bij de realisatie en implementatie van de oplossingen door de scrumteams. Je ontwikkelt het technische detailontwerp voor de infrastructuur, stelt de acceptatiecriteria op voor de applicatie- en infrastructuurcomponenten en ondersteunt bij de planning van de werkzaamheden. Ook signaleer je de belangrijkste issues. Voor het management van de Dienst ICT ben je een van de adviseurs over onder meer kosten, processen en risico\\'s.</p>\\n<p>Wat jouw functie nóg uitdagender maakt: je stelt de roadmap op voor oplossingen en borgt de samenhang van de (deel)architecturen voor applicaties en infrastructuur. Daarbij kijk je ook naar de toekomst. Vanuit de productielijn onderzoeken we hoe we met bijvoorbeeld omnichannel-instrumenten en artificial intelligence de communicatie tussen burgers en de politie verder kunnen optimaliseren. Jij verkent de technologische ontwikkelingen op de markt die daarvoor in aanmerking komen en vertaalt die naar het werkveld van onze organisatie. Zo draag jij achter de schermen bij aan het motto van de politie: waakzaam en dienstbaar.</p>\\n<p>Goed om te weten: omdat je tweede- en derdelijns vraagstukken kunt oplossen, draai je mee in 24/7-piketdiensten.</p>\\n<p><strong>Waar ga je werken?</strong>\\nHet Productiehuis bouwt met zeven productielijnen aan een betrouwbare en flexibele informatievoorziening die de operationele politiemedewerkers ondersteunt. De productielijn Connect werkt in twee clusters aan diensten die bijdragen aan de interne informatievoorziening en aan de verbinding van de politie met burgers. Met multidisciplinaire DevOps-teams beheren, verbeteren en vernieuwen we die tientallen applicaties.</p>\\n<p>Je gaat als IT-projectmanager aan de slag in het Systemteam dat de beide clusters van de productielijn technisch ondersteunt. Daarbij richt jij je, binnen de lijnen die de domeinarchitect heeft uitgezet, op de diensten voor digitaal politiecontact vanuit de buitenwereld. Je krijgt de vrijheid om binnen de gestelde kaders voor de beste, slimste en snelste oplossing te gaan. Voor vragen kun je niet alleen bij de domeinarchitect van de productielijn terecht, maar ook bij andere experts onder de ongeveer duizend collega’s binnen het Productiehuis. Op jouw beurt breng je als coach de junior solution-architect uit het Systemteam naar een hoger niveau.</p>\\n<p><strong>Wie ben jij?</strong>\\nLef en overtuigingskracht. Die eigenschappen zet je dagelijks in. Want jij durft van de gebaande paden af te wijken en binnen de kaders nieuwe ontwikkelingen uit de markt aan te dragen die nu van nut zijn voor de politie. En als geen ander ben je in staat om zowel je collega’s uit de multidisciplinaire teams als interne opdrachtgevers mee te nemen in jouw oplossingen. Bovendien kun je gemakkelijk wisselen van abstractieniveau en perspectief, en afwijkingen op de architectuur en voorschriften inzichtelijk maken. Ook kun je helder communiceren, goed netwerken en vlot onderbouwde beslissingen nemen. En altijd heb je oog voor de klant. Verder heb je:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>een hbo-diploma in een ICT-richting;</li>\\n<li>ervaring als IT-projectmanager in een corporate omgeving;</li>\\n<li>een OCA- en OCP- of vergelijkbaar certificaat, of aantoonbare ervaring met Java-ontwikkeling;</li>\\n<li>minimaal twee jaar ervaring met de ontwikkeling van applicaties;</li>\\n<li>kennis van en ervaring met containerorkestratieplatformen, en Kafka, Confluent en/of RabbitMQ;</li>\\n<li>kennis van Agile ontwikkelmethoden en risicomanagement en ervaring met beveiligingsaspecten voor softwarearchitectuur.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Wat wij bieden</strong>\\nDe standplaats is Odijk. Er is ruimte voor 1 fte. Het betreft een functie voor 36 uur per week. Omdat goede mensen belangrijk zijn binnen de politie investeren we in jouw toekomst. We bieden uitgebreide ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden en een vaste aanstelling, waarbij een proeftijd van één jaar van toepassing is.</p>\\n<p>Verder kun je het volgende van ons verwachten:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>een bruto maandsalaris van minimaal € 2.866,- en maximaal € 4.624,- (schaal 10 Bbp) op basis van een 36-urige werkweek;</li>\\n<li>8% vakantie- en 8,33% eindejaarsuitkering;</li>\\n<li>goede pensioenregeling en betaald ouderschapsverlof (<a href=\"https://kombijde.politie.nl/vakgebieden/arbeidsvoorwaarden\">meer info over verlof, regelingen en mogelijkheden</a>).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>De formele functie binnen het functiegebouw van de politie is <a href=\"https://kombijde.politie.nl/binaries/content/assets/academie/lfnp/lfnp62.pdf\">bedrijfsvoeringspecialist B</a>, werkterrein informatie- en communicatietechnologie.</p>\\n',\n",

Good fit if you like moving fast, having impact, and working on a variety of different things.</p>\\n<h2>Who we are</h2>\\n<p>We’re a fast-moving startup with a vision to empower all professionals by helping them build better relationships. Our vision is to fix the network gap: the inequality of opportunity driven by not having the right connections. To solve this problem, we’re combining the best practices of the world’s top relationship builders with artificial intelligence.</p>\\n<p>We’re building a mission-driven team that strives to live out our values every day:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Customer-centricity</li>\\n<li>Diversity of perspective</li>\\n<li>Authenticity</li>\\n<li>Growth (individual and collective)</li>\\n<li>Impact</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>We’re an ambitious, driven team and we push ourselves to accomplish a lot quickly. In the past couple of years we've gone through one of the world's top accelerators, raised two rounds of venture financing, launched our product, rapidly grown our customer base, and architected a robust set of machine learning models as a core source of competitive advantage. In the process, we’ve been named one of Chicago’s top 50 startups to watch, one of Chicago Inno’s 50 on Fire, a part of the highly selective Google for Startups Black Founders Accelerator and Black Founders Fund. And we’re just getting started!</p>\\n<h2>The opportunity</h2>\\n<p>4Degrees is at an inflection point - we’ve built a product that’s pioneering a new category of software (relationship intelligence), and are rapidly growing.  We're well funded, have hundreds of highly engaged customers, who consistently increase their contract size with us, and are planning with us on how we can take this company into the future.  We’ve done this with a scrappy, early-stage team.</p>\\n<p>The opportunity ahead of us is vast - every business that relies on their relationship network to drive their business has a use case for 4Degrees.  To seize that opportunity, we're looking for great engineers to help us build on top of the foundation we've created, while also pioneering new ways to help our customers unlock the value their relationships can bring to their business.  You’ll build and use a versatile set of skills: switching between tasks like rolling out major new functionality, diagnosing and fixing bugs, and playing support for other front-end or back-end engineers.</p>\\n<p>By joining us, you will play a highly impactful role in re-inventing the way professional relationships are managed and building a rapidly growing category. Along the way, you’ll have an opportunity to get unrivaled exposure to all facets of building a startup, and directly shape the outcomes of 4Degrees and its customers.  And if you want to build a company of your own after joining us, you'll get direct mentorship from the founding team and support in doing so!</p>\\n<h2>The impact you’ll make by joining us</h2>\\n<h3>Within 1 month you’ll:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Complete our onboarding process - which will help you ramp up on our company, vision, product, key objectives, and how your role will contribute to all of those!</li>\\n<li>Dive deep into our product development process and understand how we go from concept to design to implementation</li>\\n<li>Learn our technical stack and apply development patterns throughout your work</li>\\n<li>Ship your first small feature to our customers</li>\\n<li>Join our customer outreach program - including sitting in on your first set of live conversations with existing customers.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Within 3 months you’ll:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Assume ownership of a quarterly roadmap project, which will enable you to drive the development of a key piece of functionality for our customers</li>\\n<li>Drive timely resolution of customer issues, in coordination with the customer success and implementation teams.</li>\\n<li>Have made a visible impact on the product for all 4Degrees users</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Within 6 months you’ll:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Reliably ship full features to our customers and for internal team use</li>\\n<li>Understand the product at scale and be able to provide input to improve our technical systems and tools</li>\\n<li>Be comfortable navigating most of our stack and infrastructure</li>\\n<li>Participate in interviewing and hiring, as a way to influence team growth and how our values inform our culture</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Within 1-2 years, you’ll:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Be responsible for the planning, scoping, design, and implementation of new features</li>\\n<li>Champion future engineering initiatives</li>\\n<li>Help build and shape the future of engineering at 4Degrees</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>About you</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Excited about the 4Degrees mission and believes in our core values</li>\\n<li>Thrives in a fast-paced environment, and is comfortable with experimentation and risk-taking</li>\\n<li>Driven by the opportunity to create impact, and takes full ownership of achieving personal and team objectives</li>\\n<li>Motivated to explore the potential for technology to augment people’s ability to form and strengthen professional relationships</li>\\n<li>Challenges existing industry best practices and takes inspiration from disparate sources to build a groundbreaking product</li>\\n<li>Collaborative mindset - recognizing that most great outcomes are accomplished by teams, not individuals</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Skills you’ll need</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Proficiency with back-end programming (Python preferred, but we can train you if you're good with Ruby, Node, PHP, etc.)</li>\\n<li>Proficiency with front-end programming in vanilla languages (Javascript, HTML, CSS)</li>\\n<li>Comfort with plain SQL and an ORM</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>We’d be really excited if you are</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Experienced with mobile development, particularly using React Native</li>\\n<li>Experienced with the Flask web framework</li>\\n<li>Experienced with machine learning and/or statistical analysis</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Benefits</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Competitive cash+equity compensation based on level of capability</li>\\n<li>Unlimited PTO (min. 2 weeks, avg. 3-4)</li>\\n<li>Unlimited paid sick leave (mandatory for infectious diseases)</li>\\n<li>Employer group health insurance, subsidized 75% by company</li>\\n<li>Annual professional development stipend</li>\\n<li>Commuter benefits</li>\\n</ul>\\n\",\n",

I am currently a Cloud Solution Architect working with Azure offerings. I’d say I am not your typical solution architect as my background is actually in Business Administration that I’ve studied at Stockholm’s University and I really like strategic management. I moved into IT as a developer a couple of years ago to follow my passion for technology. Working in this part of the business gives me opportunity to combine both strategic management and IT, while being part of Microsoft makes this work even more fun and developing. There are endless opportunities to learn and try new things, and you have access to a bunch of resources through our library, as well as industry experts through the internal communities. When I am not working, I try new food together with my friends, drag them all on big group trips and events, or do yoga.</li>\\n<li>…..I am Dennis van de Wege, Cloud Solutions Architect on the field of Azure Apps &amp; Infra. I was never the IT guy. I actually wanted to become a fighter pilot for the Royal Air Force in the Netherlands. Then at the beginning of 2017 a company from Rotterdam reached out to me if I was interested in a traineeship working with hybrid cloud. I accepted their offer and rolled into the program. This changed my life.</li>\\n<li>After two years I was contacted by Microsoft. As a CSA my work basically is to be the trusted technical advisor of my customers. I am the technical person that helps customers with technical questions, concerns and issues. One example is that I lead deep technical architecture discussions with senior customer executives, architects, IT Management and developers to drive core infrastructure solutions and data centre migrations. Another example is that I can reach out to various resources within Microsoft for specific knowledge. Within my work it’s also great that I always keep learning. You have the opportunity to teach, to learn and to visit and meet with colleagues that are the absolute world experts in their field.</li>\\n<li>Meet more CSAs</li>\\n<li>... we would love to hear from you</li>\\n<li>Microsoft values different life experiences and viewpoints.

       "  'description': '<h2>Lead the development of user-friendly front-end solutions that do so much to enable the success of our international transport company</h2>\\n<p>Samskip is a large, international company that organizes thousands of goods transports every week. Our success depends substantially on a web portal that enables customers (and employees) to perform daily actions such as booking sea-freights and ordering containers. It’s a valuable 24/7 resource, run by an experienced team that is committed to the highest professional standards. If you think you could take the lead in front-end web development for this portal, please read on.</p>\\n<h2>Front-end excellence within a collaborative and professional environment</h2>\\n<p>You will be part of the team that focuses on developing a robust and efficient Customer Portal (Service Web). The team works with legacy systems such as ReactJS and AngularJS (maintained by Facebook) and .NET Core and ASP.NET stack (maintained by Microsoft).</p>\\n<p>Central to this effort is the ongoing development of attractive and user-friendly UIs. Your role is to act as team leader for this front-end web development, evolving interesting web designs that hundreds of people can easily interact with and rely on every day.</p>\\n<p>The development team strives for mature, stable development frameworks that deliver competitive software performance, eliminate the risk of failure, and ensure scalability for future developments. This is achieved through continuous development within an agile, modernized software environment where business needs can be solved quickly on an ongoing basis.</p>\\n<h2>Flexible, professional and organized</h2>\\n<p>As a Front-End Web Developer, you need the flexibility necessary to deliver predefined web designs while at the same time taking the initiative and proposing improvements to existing designs. Further, you should be an organized multi-tasker who can commit to a predefined sprint plan whilst also performing hotfixes that need to be solved ASAP. And you always show up on time for team meetings such as Planning-, Retro-, Daily- and Demo meetings. Your specific responsibilities include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Maintaining and developing fully scalable websites and securing professional UX;</li>\\n<li>Taking the lead in front-end web development;</li>\\n<li>Implementing professional web designs and deliver UIs that attract users;</li>\\n<li>Dealing with ad-hoc requirements and/or issues with web designs your team is responsible for.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>This is the place to get ahead</h2>\\n<p>Samskip is committed to innovating and applying sustainable and multimodal transport links across Europe. Our office in Cluj-Napoca plays an important role in this network. It’s busy, it’s fun and every day is different as you work with a diverse range of colleagues to deliver 21st-century solutions for a large portfolio of well-known customers.</p>\\n<p>Moreover, we want you to grow and thrive with us. That’s why you’ll have access to wide-ranging development opportunities including training and e-learning through our Samskip Academy.

In particular, you have extensive experience with frameworks such as ReactJS, Angular, Vue etc. As a leader, you also need knowledge of stylesheets such as CSS / SASS / LESS.</p>\\n<p>Implementing a proposed web design comes naturally to you, and you have a sharp eye for general UX improvements. It is essential that you always think in terms of finding universal scalability and you go the extra mile for fully scalable web designs. Above all, you love working in SCRUM / Kanban Agile continuous development environment. We are a cross-functional team working with a mono-repo so experience of collaborative development with Git is key. The back-end is mostly RESTful .NET APIs, so basic C# experience is a big plus.</p>\\n<p>You also know your way around CSS, LESS, SASS, REST, HTTP, Swagger, Angular, React and Git. Although the development team always strives for modernized web development you will sometimes need to improve, coordinate, and add scalability to existing or older web designs.</p>\\n<p>All of this demands highly evolved critical thinking and problem-solving skills, along with the ability to quickly master new techniques. Deadlines are often tight so you must have the flexibility to respond effectively under pressure to last-minute changes and priorities. You also need excellent communication and collaboration skills as you influence, negotiate and present information to engage others in our quest for framework simplicity and efficient future maintenance. The more technical requirements are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A degree in Computer Science or similar and proven work experience of implementing fully scalable web designs;</li>\\n<li>Proven work experience with today’s leading web frameworks such as ReactJS, Angular, AngularJS and/or Vue;</li>\\n<li>Transport / Logistics industry experience is a plus;</li>\\n<li>Good knowledge of HTML, CSS, SASS / LESS (experience with Tailwind is a plus), XML and JSON;</li>\\n<li>Excellent knowledge of ReactJS (experience with Redux is a plus) and basic knowledge of Angular and/or AngularJS;</li>\\n<li>Good knowledge of a RESTful infrastructure, with basic knowledge of C#, .NET Core and ASP.NET a plus;</li>\\n<li>Excellent knowledge of Visual Studio Code and front-end development extensions;</li>\\n<li>Excellent knowledge of Git (experience with GitFlow is a plus);</li>\\n<li>Basic knowledge of cloud infrastructure and experience with CI / CD setup (experience with Microsoft Azure is a plus);</li>\\n<li>Excellent written and spoken English.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Get to the front-end of the queue!</h2>\\n<p>Do you think you could be a great asset to Samskip based on everything you’ve read here?

The team practices continuous development within an agile, modernized software environment where business needs can be solved quickly on an ongoing basis.</p>\\n<h2>Flexible, professional and organized</h2>\\n<p>As a Full Stack Software Engineer you need the flexibility to work on specialized front- and back-end projects simultaneously. Further, you should be an organized multi-tasker who can commit to a predefined sprint plan whilst also performing hotfixes that need to be solved ASAP.

We are reinventing build engineering with an on-demand SaaS Platform and CLI tool that lets developers automate the building of any runtime environment using any open source language ecosystem on any platform. In Beta right now, we support Python and Perl and we\\'re hiring to add more languages and packages! We’re building an ambitious language distribution platform so that no engineer ever has to suffer dependency hell again, and we need your help to add Java to it!</p>\\n<p><strong>This position is available to remote workers anywhere in the world, as long as you are able to work on a schedule that aligns with our core North American business hours of 10:00am - 4:00pm PST.</strong> You can also choose to work from our headquarters in beautiful Vancouver, BC once the health situation makes this possible.</p>\\n<p><strong>What You’ll be Doing</strong>\\nAs a  Java Language Specialist on our team, you are responsible for using your deep understanding of Java -- its internals, dependency management, idioms, and community -- to teach our Platform to build and distribute Java for multiple Operating Systems. We’re building from source. Note this is not a Java development role. Rather you\\'ll be writing software to create custom Java distributions and this software won\\'t necessarily be written in Java. You’ve been bitten by Java and have successfully tamed it.</p>\\n<p>Our day to day work practices are centered around GitHub, pull requests, code review, CI for testing, and agile development with Pivotal Tracker as our project management tool. We’re always looking to improve our practices and we expect you to help us to do so.</p>\\n<p>Our team is scattered around the US and Canada, so we coordinate with each other and the rest of the company using Slack for chat, Highfive for video calls and screen sharing, Pivotal Tracker, and Google Drive.</p>\\n<p>We like to use open source software whenever possible, and we also like to contribute back to the open source ecosystem. We embrace open sourcing both libraries and tools developed in-house as long as those are not mission-critical code.</p>\\n<p><strong>What’s in it for You</strong>\\n-Working for a stable and growing company that offers the environment and personal growth potential of a start-up.\\n-The chance to work with a smart, passionate team of people.\\n-Competitive salary, bonus, and stock option plan.\\n-Comprehensive benefits package and health/wellness credit program.</p>\\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Deep understanding of the Java platform, its packaging ecosystem, and how to build Java and its dependencies.</li>\\n<li>Understand how JDK binaries are built and used</li>\\n<li>Understand how Maven dependency management works</li>\\n<li>Experience with C/C++ programming on multiple operating systems (Windows/UNIX/OSX) and the build system for a Java distribution (e.g. OpenJDK)</li>\\n<li>Ability to work in multiple languages. We use Python, Go, Perl, and other languages as needed.</li>\\n<li>Excellent written and spoken skills, both technical and non-technical. You’ll need to work closely with your developer teammates, as well as be able to have coherent conversations with people from QA, sales, marketing, and other parts of the company.</li>\\n<li>A willingness to engage in the process of defining our work through conversations with product management, other engineering teams, and the rest of the company.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Assets</strong></p>\\n<p>If you have experience with any of the following please make sure to highlight it in your cover letter:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You are a maintainer, contributor to the core Java code base, or have a popular Java based Open Source project. We make special accommodations to help you maintain those activities.</li>\\n<li>A deep understanding of Maven and/or Nexus, especially their pros and cons, especially private artifact repositories.</li>\\n<li>Practical experience with Java 9 modules</li>\\n<li>Experience with JLink</li>\\n<li>Experience working on a build system outside of an IDE.</li>\\n<li>Agile processes, including breaking large projects up into smaller stories, estimation, working in branches (GitHub Flow), code review, and CI.</li>\\n<li>C or C++ code and debugging compiler issues across platforms.</li>\\n<li>Perl, Python, Tcl, or Java, especially an understanding of their respective language communities and their toolchains.</li>\\n<li>Big iron operating systems including Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX.</li>\\n<li>Build tools such as make, autotools, bazel, etc.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Working at ActiveState</strong>\\nActiveState has a collaborative, respectful, and professional culture. We’re all about working together to find the best solutions, and making sure that the experience of doing so is positive for everyone involved. There is a commitment from the CEO on down to making work at ActiveState a great experience for all of us.</p>\\n<p>Our company is a team of 50+ and growing, with 2/3rds of the positions in technical roles  including software development and QA. We maintain a set of core, overlapping hours, but we’re flexible with specific start and end times and are understanding about appointments and life events.</p>\\n<p>Our vision is to have an ActiveState solution on every device on every planet, so we certainly don’t lack for ambition! But even though we’re ambitious we don’t expect work to become your life. We know you will do your best work in a positive environment free from death marches.

In addition, contribute to law enforcement in the Netherlands. You will only find that unique combination at the Netherlands Forensic Institute, where you get to work as a digital forensic researcher and examiner.</p>\\n<p>As a digital expert in the field of mobile device hacking, you will strengthen the Digital Technology team. Your challenge? Reverse engineer the workings and security of mobile consumer devices. Develop a method on a reference device in such a way that it can be applied on confiscated devices, in order to extract the data or break through the security and recover the information within the device.</p>\\n<p>You will collaborate with experts of the Digital Technology team that are proficient in reverse engineering, engineering, crypto, and data-analysis. You will support the development of setups that are used to analyse target devices with side-channel analysis and fault injection. On the other hand, you will familiarise yourself in attack concepts developed by others and adjust these for use in forensic cases.</p>\\n<p>Both on a software and hardware level, using your low-level knowledge of embedded devices, the code you will develop will run close to the firmware or even lower, so stable measurements can be acquired. You will make small changes in the hardware of target devices in order to access relevant signals and optimize measurement setups. To be able to do so, you will analyse software (reverse engineering) and hardware of the target devices at the lowest level, for a large part in a black box scenario.</p>\\n<p>Obtaining access of secured mobile devices is a multidisciplinary problem that includes other fields of expertise such as chip-off, silicon analysis, exploit development, FPGA-engineering, and cryptography. This is why you will include your colleagues in the team Digital Technology and their international partners where necessary. Besides this, you can shape and focus your research by yourself. You must be able to work well individually, but you do not hesitate to ask for help when needed and have a pragmatic attitude.</p>\\n<p><strong>Functie-eisen</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Proven, preferably practical, low-level knowledge of embedded systems (hardware and firmware).</li>\\n<li>Provable, preferably practical, knowledge of Android’s chain of trust.</li>\\n<li>Knowledge of FDE, FBE, Keymaster and StrongBox is preferred.</li>\\n<li>Provable, preferably practical knowledge and experience with (hardware) reverse engineering.</li>\\n<li>Experience with software reverse engineering on a variety of layers (ROM, firmware, kernel, PBL, SBL, XBL, aboot, sboot, Android) is preferred.</li>\\n<li>Knowledge of trusted execution environments is preferred.</li>\\n<li>You have an affinity with simulating firmware.</li>\\n<li>Experience (or affinity with) with micro-soldering is preferred.</li>\\n<li>University level education, preferably with a large computer security component.</li>\\n<li>You have a wide interest of integrated components, signal analysis, and cryptography.</li>\\n<li>You are able to focus on and execute your own research and communicate about this with your colleagues.</li>\\n<li>You are a team player, good in collaborating, and like to take initiative.</li>\\n<li>You have an affinity with hardware development (FPGAs, PCB-development).</li>\\n<li>You have an affinity with software development (VHDL, C, Python).</li>\\n<li>You have an affinity with security and justice.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Competencies</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>analytical ability</li>\\n<li>judgement</li>\\n<li>persuasiveness</li>\\n<li>collaborate</li>\\n<li>planning and organising</li>\\n<li>creativity</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Arbeidsvoorwaarden\\nSalarisniveau</strong>: schaal 10, schaal 11\\n<strong>Salarisomschrijving</strong>: A temporary 8% allowance on top of the monthly salary is applicable because of tight labour market conditions.\\n<strong>Maandsalaris</strong>: Min €2.756 – Max. €5.039 (bruto)\\n<strong>Dienstverband</strong>: Arbeidsovereenkomst voor bepaalde tijd met uitzicht op onbepaalde tijd\\n<strong>Contractduur</strong>: 1 year\\n<strong>Maximaal aantal uren per week</strong>: 36</p>\\n<p><strong>Overige arbeidsvoorwaarden</strong>\\nIn addition to the salary, you receive a so-called individual choice budget (ICB).

       "  'description': '<h2><strong>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</strong></h2>\\n<p>We build “You Need a Budget,” the best budgeting software and education resources around. (Those in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab.”) For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab\">Google us</a>, or read some of our <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877\">reviews on the app store</a>, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p>\\n<p>We have big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our <a href=\"https://app.youneedabudget.com\">web app</a> and <a href=\"https://api.youneedabudget.com/\">API</a>. All of those plans necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in!</p>\\n<p>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit\">Cultural Manifesto</a> has to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading this, you’ll probably fit right in!</p>\\n<p>Of course, we have some firm* requirements too, like five years of full-stack professional web application development experience. For us this means you either know the server-side really well and have some client-side experience, or you’re an absolute expert on front-end development and have some server-side know-how.</p>\\n<p>*Well, firm-<em>ish</em>. If you know you’re a great fit for this role but fall short of the five-year requirement, include a specific pitch with your application on why we should consider you anyway! How you pitch us is up to you, just make sure it’s short and creative.</p>\\n<p>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB, and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p>\\n<h2><strong>Who You’d Be Working With</strong></h2>\\n<p>Our developer team is about 25 people strong, and we frequently operate in cross-functional teams, so you’ll get to work with awesome people from all different roles in the company.</p>\\n<p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional lively board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in creative ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p>\\n<p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our amazing designers. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy®) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they welcome feedback and suggestions during the development process and are happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them it will save you significant development effort.</p>\\n<h2><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></h2>\\n<p>We strive hard to make working at YNAB a unique and fantastic experience (we’ve even been named <a href=\"https://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/you-need-a-budget/\">Fortune’s #1 Best Small Company to Work For</a>). We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p>\\n<h3><strong>Responsibility and Empowerment</strong></h3>\\n<p>YNAB appreciates, respects, and trusts the expertise and judgment of our developers. We empower them to do what they think is right.</p>\\n<p>We also work collaboratively. We continuously seek the right amount of structure and unity necessary to maximize productivity. Where it makes sense, we designate someone to make a call.</p>\\n<p>Even though our developers are right a lot, it\\'s okay to make mistakes here. Exploration and calculated risks are vital to velocity and growth. We freely admit when we\\'re wrong. If something doesn\\'t go as expected, we learn, bounce back, and make corrections.</p>\\n<p>You won\\'t be alone; others will be there to help, review, reassure, and back you up. We own our processes and collective outcomes as a team.</p>\\n<h3><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></h3>\\n<p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want, as long as it’s somewhere between the Pacific Time Zone (UTC-8) and the Central European Time Zone (UTC+1). Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p>\\n<h3><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></h3>\\n<p>We want everyone to have a full life outside of YNAB. We seldom work more than 40 hours per week. There have been rare occasions where things got a little crazy, and people logged some extra hours. But then they took additional time off to balance it all out. We work hard and smart, but we’re in this for the long haul; there’s no need to go crazy on the hours.</p>\\n<h3><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></h3>\\n<p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get plenty of downtime and get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your adventures in our #office_wall Slack channel.</p>\\n<h3><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></h3>\\n<p>When the pandemic isn’t keeping us from traveling, we get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fs1TN-jrDI&amp;t\">Costa Rica</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/\">gigantic cabin</a> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and most recently, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Laguna Beach</a>. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being together and having a blast.</p>\\n<h3><strong>Up Your Game</strong></h3>\\n<p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new. We love to see our people grow.</p>\\n<h3><strong>International is Absolutely Okay</strong></h3>\\n<p>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. We are already spread across the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.</p>\\n<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>\\n<p>We offer excellent health, dental, and vision insurance for our US employees, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, we’ve got you covered!)</p>\\n<p>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB matches your contributions, up to six percent of your paycheck. Matches vest immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)</p>\\n<h3><strong>Competitive Compensation</strong></h3>\\n<p>We use a leading compensation data provider to set competitive and well-defined pay ranges for all of our positions. Your pay is the same no matter where you live, and our goal is to pay at or above the market rate in the United States. We consider raises every year and have a bonus plan based on profitability, which you’re in on from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</p>\\n<h3><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li>\\n<li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and the holidays.</li>\\n<li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor. We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried <em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li>\\n<li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a top-of-the-line computer and phone and will replace them regularly.</li>\\n<li>Did we mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in building something easy and joyful to use that helps millions of people discover budgeting as an essential financial and life-planning tool. <em><strong>You</strong> will change lives.</em></p>\\n<h2><strong>You, Our New Senior Full Stack Developer</strong></h2>\\n<p>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least five years of experience building, shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites).</p>\\n<p>You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).</p>\\n<p>Some client-side experience is required as a minimum, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).</p>\\n<p>If your focus has been more on front-end development, then you\\'re among the best of the best with a client-side framework such as Ember and also have some server-side depth.</p>\\n<p>You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.</p>\\n<p>You’ll do things like help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third-party APIs, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>“How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”</li>\\n<li>“We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”</li>\\n<li>“We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?”</li>\\n<li>“We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”</li>\\n</ul>\\n<strong>You’re our person if:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.</li>\\n<li>You write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li>\\n<li>You have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.</li>\\n<li>You are comfortable with JavaScript and have developed a user facing front-end with a web framework such as Ember, Vue, React, or Angular.</li>\\n<li>You know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)</li>\\n<li>You have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops.” That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</li>\\n<li>While perhaps not a security specialist, you are aware of how websites and services can be exploited, are security conscious while you code, and protective of customer data and privacy.</li>\\n<li>You have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li>\\n<li>You already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement, but we’ll give you bonus points for this one.)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<strong>Examples of things you might be working on at YNAB:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Integrating with 3rd party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services</li>\\n<li>Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times</li>\\n<li>Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use</li>\\n<li>Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything</li>\\n<li>Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues</li>\\n<li>Updating behavior or adding a new UI component to our web app</li>\\n<li>Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites</li>\\n<li>Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2><strong>Diversity</strong></h2>\\n<p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe a diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, abilities, and experiences is critical to our success. We are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, experienced, and diverse team that loves working together to build something that matters.</p>\\n<h2><strong>How to Apply</strong></h2>\\n<p><strong>Apply by 11:59PM on April 25th, 2021.</strong> Firm. It’s a real deadline.</p>\\n<p>Write a cover letter and attach it as a PDF. In your cover letter:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>Introduce yourself, tell us why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit. <em>This portion of the cover letter should be less than a page and a half.</em></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>On a separate page of your cover letter, please answer the following questions. <em>Each response should be about a paragraph in length:</em></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>What criteria do you look for when searching for your next company or position?</li>\\n<li>What are your favorite and least favorite parts of your current job?</li>\\n<li>Tell us about a time when you had to learn something new to excel at your job.</li>\\n<li>Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable.)</li>\\n<li>Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.</li>\\n<li>If you were interviewing a prospective developer for this position, what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Complete this short coding test in your language of choice and include a link to your results in your cover letter. This shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so: <a href=\"https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/PVNGB2\">https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/PVNGB2</a></p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! In that case, please just include an informal list of your work and education history or a link to your LinkedIn profile.</p>\\n<p>Please send all attachments as PDFs.</p>\\n<p>P.S.  If this position isn’t right for you at this time, but you know someone else who might be interested, we’d really appreciate it if you passed this along!</p>\\n',\n",

In order not to re-invent everything ourselves, we use a multitude of standard libraries, which we load via the Composer package manager. These are libraries of Symfony, Laravel and Zend, among others.</p>\\n<p>To make it easier to replace a library when it is no longer maintained, we make use of a wrapper. When looking for a new library, we always prefer a library that complies with a PSR standard. In this way we are not dependent on the success of a single framework and at the same time we do not produce code for which a good library is already available.</p>\\n<p>For the architecture we use the “Hexagonal Architecture”. This is based on the idea of \\u200b\\u200bLayers, Ports and Adapters. The aim is to write good testable code in which the business logic is separated from the infrastructure as much as possible.

Data is at the core of what we do and so the team is both analytical and data-driven in its decision making.</p>\\n<p>We often find ourselves playing cat and mouse games with pirates who are at the cutting edge of web technologies. Therefore, we try to promote a hacking culture, where the ability to be pragmatic and move fast in an incremental fashion is critical. We believe in using the right tool for the job, which can often mean using the pirate’s own tools against them. We strive for technical excellence and so we take time to regularly share knowledge and technical expertise between team members.</p>\\n<p>Innovation is incredibly important to us and you will have the autonomy needed to re-imagine our existing systems and processes, as well as coming up with new ones.

Outsystems is onze 2e ontwikkelstraat naast de al langer bestaande .NET ontwikkelstraat.  De backlog van de Outsystems teams groeit flink en daarom zijn we op zoek naar een ervaren Outsystems developer.</p>\\n<p><em>Jouw baan als Senior Outsystems developer</em>\\nAls Senior Outsystems developer werk je vanuit een klein team met enthousiaste en gedreven collega’s aan back-end oplossingen. Het team beheert en ontwikkelt softwaresystemen t.b.v. de communicatie met deelnemers via pensioenoverzichten (UPO’s) en via het Pensioenregister <a href=\"https://www.mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl\">www.mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl</a>. Het huidige systeem is gebouwd in .NET en zal nieuw gebouwd worden in Outsystems. Met jouw kennis van Outsystems speel je een belangrijke rol in het begeleiden van de transitie van het huidige team, samen met collega’s van het al bestaande Outsystems team.</p>\\n<p>Jouw rol als developer is onderdeel van een breed scala aan activiteiten van het team: het analyseren, ontwikkelen, testen en beheren van IT-oplossingen. Wat je doet, hangt af van wat er nodig is voor het team. Je zult je constant moeten aanpassen aan wat nodig is, waarbij je prioriteit is om te leveren wat je belooft: toekomstbestendige IT-oplossingen.</p>\\n<p><strong>Jouw afdeling binnen PGGM</strong>\\nSamen met 6 collega’s werk je in scrumteam Pensioencommunicatie, dat jaarlijks ruim 3 miljoen pensioenoverzichten voor deelnemers maakt, en 1,5 miljoen raadplegingen van <a href=\"https://www.mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl\">www.mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl</a> ondersteunt.</p>\\n<p>Je komt te werken in een zelfsturend team, met een groot verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel. Het team is onderdeel van Pensioenbeheer IT waar ongeveer 150 IT medewerkers samenwerken aan de uitdagende veranderkalender, o.a. de voorbereiding op het nieuwe pensioencontract, maar uiteraard ook aan de run.</p>\\n<p>In onze professionele werkomgeving krijg je volop kansen om jouw vakmanschap te tonen en met de nieuwste tooling en technieken te werken.</p>\\n<p><strong>Jouw achtergrond</strong>\\nFouten maken? Als senior developer ben jij hier niet bang voor. Sterker nog, jij weet dat dit erbij hoort om elke dag beter te worden. Ook als er niet om gevraagd wordt pak jij alle noodzakelijke werkzaamheden op, dus soms ook test(automatisering), soms bouw, soms analyse, etc. Je houdt van afwisseling en vindt het leuk om met mensen van de business samen de juiste oplossing te zoeken. Door te observeren en te luisteren vallen jou zaken op, stelt vragen en komt met ideeën voor verbetering. Je biedt actief hulp aan en staat er open voor dat iemand resultaat bereikt via een andere weg, ook al is die misschien minder efficiënt en snel. Je laat iemand in zijn waarde, maar prikkelt wel om te verbeteren. Je maakt een goede afweging tussen resultaat, kwaliteit en tijd. En die afweging wordt constant getoetst en bijgesteld, door met de andere betrokkenen te praten. In jouw beleving gaat het er niet om dat IT fantastisch is, maar dat IT er is om Pensioenbeheer haar werk beter te laten doen.</p>\\n<p>Verder beschik je over:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Hbo werk- en denkniveau, bij voorkeur door een opleiding in een technische richting.</li>\\n<li>Minimaal 2 jaar ervaring als Outsystems developer.</li>\\n<li>Kennis van .Net en SQL is een pré.</li>\\n<li>Interesse in (pensioen)functionaliteit.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Dutch speaking candidates only.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Wat wij bieden:</strong>\\nVolop kansen om jezelf te ontwikkelen in een groene werkomgeving in het midden van het land (Zeist, Utrecht), waar het gaat om meer dan geld alleen.
